"""Node contract (inside the context agent).

An agent is just a function `(State) -> dict`: read what you need from the state and return
ONLY the keys you produce. LangGraph merges that into the shared state.

Deterministic agents (v1) are plain functions. Later, an LLM agent is the same thing, e.g.:

    from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
    llm = init_chat_model("claude-sonnet-4-5")

    def summarizer_node(state: State) -> dict:
        ...  # call llm / a langchain agent, return {"summaries": {...}}
